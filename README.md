# Numerical-Integration

This repository contains a Python implementation of two methods for numerical integration - Simpson's Rule and Adaptive Quadrature. The goal of this project is to illustrate the use and efficiency of these methods through practical application on various functions.

## Project Description

The project is organized in two parts:

#### 1. Implementation of Integration Methods: 
This part includes the Python code for Simpson's Rule and Adaptive Quadrature methods implemented using NumPy. This code was developed in a Spyder environment.
#### 2. Jupyter Notebook:
This part consists of a Jupyter Notebook where the theory behind these methods is explained. The functions are tested using the implemented methods, and the results are visualized with Matplotlib. The notebook serves as an interactive platform to understand the application and performance of the numerical integration methods.


## Contents

The repository contains the following:

- quadrature.py: Python script containing the implementation of Simpson's Rule and Adaptive Quadrature methods.
- Numerical Integration Project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook that uses the implemented methods, explains the theory, and visualizes the results.
- README.md: The file you're reading now.
